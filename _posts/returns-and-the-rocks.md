Memory is fickle, and - for the most part - a bad friend. It insists, interrupts, and instigates struggle, taking and rarely giving anything of substance. It drinks our booze, smokes our cigarettes, crashes on the couch, and is gone the next morning, only to show up again unannounced, and uninvited. 

Yet, its beauty remains. The opportunity it represents at once both a necessity and a mercy: revision. Changing what has passed for ourselves, and what is now for the world, so that from all vantage points, this time, we'll manage to avoid the rocks below, and re-emerge salty and renewed, baptized, but not unscathed.
