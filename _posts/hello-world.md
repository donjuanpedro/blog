It's been a while. Yes. A while. I think I grew out of comfort with broadcasting myself, lost touch with the age-old need to project, unapologetically, that I am here. When days are reduced to survival and comfort, the unknown is less appealing than before, and we prefer to pass in secret.

But that is changing, slowly and powerfully. Inevitably. The great pendulum commands it, and holds us close to its side, providing a different kind of comfort: that nothing, not even bad, lasts forever. And it is within this need and apart from control that I deem this a time of scheduled chaos for me. Loving and moving along the balance of my known world, beyond, once again into the unknown.
