Nothing's really happened like we thought it would. So certain for so long that efforts continuously build on each other, mindful only of our own wills - a monument to our power. But one inning can change the world, and one pitch a life. Nothing stays, and even worse/better: nothing stays for long. The precious answers we lean on from each sign in our days, they are true. They are real. You can be remade, and it probably won't even take that long at all. 

So why not yet? What is taking so long? So certain for so long that we are on the right path, the hothands fallacy. You will never be complete, no path can get you there. Perhaps the monument has meaning after all, so long as it remains unfinished. Forever making quick changes and slow moves, humming "we'll see."
