There’s not much coming from this side of the brain, this stone vault. Its purpose relies on its dormancy, allowing both the space and the emptiness that are so hard to come by these days. We have finally filled in the edges of the map, and even the monsters are looking for a safe space to just be themselves.

We come then to the true adventure, the truly infinite abyss of self, forever reappearing in front of the mind mirror. Occasionally saying “it is good,” allowing release, and promoting that very emptiness as a prerequisite to the flame, granting the illusion of a side separate and apart: a false dichotomy.
